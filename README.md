Examples of SceneryStack using Vite.

### Quick Start

(1) Clone demo-examples:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scenerystack/demo-examples.git
```

(2) Install dev dependencies:

```sh
cd demo-examples
npm install
```

(3) Run it from a browser:

The following will run a server on your local machine, and you can navigate to the URL to see the demo.

```sh
npx vite preview
```

It will print out the URL to navigate to, e.g. http://localhost:4173/. Browse to that port to see the demo!

(4) Built it:

```sh
npx vite build
```

It will be built into the `dist` directory, where dist/index.html is the entry point. The dist directory can be moved/served from wherever.

Then you can browse the built version in `dist/`.

(5) Lint it:

```sh
npx eslint .
```
